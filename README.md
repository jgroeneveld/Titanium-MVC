jg Titanium MVC
===============

A simple MVC Framework for Appcelerator Titanium structurally inspired by Rails but using desktop style MVC where each component can have its own controller.

* Models, Views, Controllers, Helpers
* psets for unobstrusive styling of components
* Javascript Object enhancements
* Helpers for Network, Localisation and DB

This Framework is not finished and obsolete. I recommend to use Appcelerator Alloy now.
